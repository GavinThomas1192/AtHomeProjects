Hello!

My name is Gavin Thomas and I am currently finishing my schooling to become a Full Stack Web Developer at Code Fellows in Seattle, Wa. I have lived in Lakewood my whole life and my best friend even attended Oakbrook Children's Center as a child. I have many fond memories riding my bike down that large hill just outside of your parking lot into the school playground!

My school encourages every student to go out into their community and try to improve the current web development condition that exists. While searching local business' I couldn't seem to find a website for your business online.

All this being said, I would love to build a website for your company! Creating an online presence in todays world of technology is not only vital, but necessary. Attached is a screenshot of a quick mock up website that can give you an example of what direction I can take you guys in. The site will be mobile-responsive and indexed correctly for Google search engines to improve your search ranking. Everything is 100% customizable and can be changed to your liking, but this will help give you a visual representation of your siteâ€™s potential. I think we could make the site significantly more engaging from here!

Here are two websites that I have built recently to give you a feeling for what I can do for you.

I created this website for Lakewood Vet Hospital just down the street.

Here is a website built for a project

If you are interested in speaking about your website, please feel free to reach out!
Thanks for your time and I hope to hear back from you!
